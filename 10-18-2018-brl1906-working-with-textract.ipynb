Based upon our examination of these and such other\\ndocuments as we deem relevant, it is our opinion that:\\n\\n1. Lessee is a political subdivision of the State of Maryland (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cState\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), duly\\norganized, existing and operating under the Constitution and laws of the State.\\n\\n2. Lessee is authorized and has power under applicable law to enter into the Lease\\nand the Escrow Agreement and to carry out its obligations thereunder and consummate the\\ntransactions contemplated thereby.\\n\\nCity of Baltimore Page 2\\nGrant Capital Master Lease\\n\\n3. The Lease and the Escrow Agreement have been duly authorized, approved,\\nexecuted and delivered by and on behalf of Lessee, and are legal, valid and binding contracts of\\nLessee enforceable in accordance with their terms, except to the extent limited by State and\\nfederal laws affecting remedies and by bankruptcy, reorganization or other laws of general\\napplication relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 rights.\\n\\n4, The lease/purchase by Lessee of the equipment listed on Schedule A No, 29 and\\nthe \\xef\\xac\\x81nancing of such lease/purchase were approved by the Board of Estimates of Baltimore City\\nat a duly and legally called and held meeting thereof on April 26, 2017\\xe2\\x80\\x98\\n\\n5. The authorization, approval and execution of the Lease and the Escrow\\nAgreement and all other proceedings of Lessee relating to the transactions contemplated thereby\\nhave been performed in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations of the State\\nand the City of Baltimore.\\n\\n6. The execution of the Lease and the Escrow Agreement and the appropriation of\\nmoneys to pay the Rental Payments (as de\\xef\\xac\\x81ned in the Lease) coming due thereunder do not and\\nwill not result in the violation of any constitutional, statutory or other limitation relating to the\\nmanner) form or amount of indebtedness which may be incurred by Lessee,\\n\\n7. There is no litigation, action, suit or proceeding pending or before any court,\\nadministrative agency, arbitrator or governmental body that challenges the organization or\\nexistence of Lessee; the authority of Lessee or its of\\xef\\xac\\x81cers or its employees to enter into the Lease\\nor the Escrow Agreement; the proper authorization, approval and/or execution of the Lease, the\\nEscrow Agreement and other documents contemplated thereby; the appropriation of moneys to\\nmake Rental Payments under the Lease for the current \\xef\\xac\\x81scal year of Lessee; or the ability of\\nLessee otherwise to perform its obligations under the Lease, the Escrow Agreement, and the\\ntransactions contemplated thereby and, to the best of my knowledge, no such litigation or actions\\nare threatened\\n\\n8.

Lessee has covenanted to comply with such restrictions and for purposes of this\\nopinion) we have relied on Lessee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s covenants and assumed its compliance therewith, and\\nassuming such compliance, we are of the opinion that the Interest Component will remain excluded\\nfrom gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103(a) of the Code,\\n\\n(2) The Interest Component is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal\\nalternative minimum tax imposed on individuals and corporations.\\n\\nThis opinion is for the sole bene\\xef\\xac\\x81t of Lessor and Capital One Public Funding, LLC, and\\nmay only be relied upon by any other permitted assignee or subassignee of all of Lessor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right,\\ntitle and interest in and to the Agreement, The opinions expressed in this letter are limited to the\\nmatters set forth in this opinion letter, and no other opinions should be inferred beyond the matters\\nexpressly herein stated.\\n\\nVery truly yours,\\n\\nWWLL\\xe2\\x80\\x98?\\n\\nATTACHMENT G TO SCHEDULE A N0. 29\\n\\nAUTHORIZING RESOLUTION OF LESSEE\\n\\n[Please provide.]\\n\\nmmmmG-l\\n11/1/2017\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c3%: m.
